## Why I created this project?

Because my _clever buddy_ [krmbzds](https://github.com/krmbzds) created an [evil application](https://github.com/krmbzds/cursemix) in a [cursed framework](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) written in a [foul language](https://github.com/ruby/ruby). Thus I wanted to do opposite (because python is all about rainbows and [gunicorns](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn))

He used Sinatra (framework dedicated to memory of a _fascinating pal_) with Ruby (a language for _charming friends_).
I used Flask with Python. We both used Haml (or hamlish-jinja).

So, let's get down to copying and pasting ^_^
